# Python Basics

This repo hosts the quarto document I presented at the TDS-F group meeting on the 29th April 2025.
The goal of the meeting was to introduce the basics of Python, especially to a R user. It is not an introduction to coding.
I cover topics such as objects, loops, plots, stats, parallelisation and mention snakemake as a pipeline management system.

The document may be useful for best practices e.g. docstrings and the basics e.g. slicing, indexing.


Please free to contact me if you have any questions.
